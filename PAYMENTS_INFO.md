# Information on payment data
There are two publications every year. There is the initial data and then a refresh.

## Types and Data Size
1. General Payments (8 GB)
2. Research Payments (1 GB)
3. Physician Ownership (2 MB)

## Strategy
Given that the data is so large, we need a way to process efficiently.

## Focus
I will first work on General Payments as it is the largest and most comprehesive. I will develop it with the idea that we can add Research Payments and Physician Payments in easily later. When the yearly refresh happens, we obviously will want to pull the changes and check for when that refresh happens.
